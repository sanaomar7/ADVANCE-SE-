the singleton idea is just one object

at the first we make a class nemad connection

and this is like a home for all methods

we decleare instance object

then go to the get instance methode create a new object if there is no object created for this given type, else return the current object for the given protocol.

the connect methode for be shure if the connection 3 or not

increment methode to copmute the number of connetion

then the type for the protocol (المطلب الرابع )

add methode foradding the protocol type in a list to get it

the relese methode to distroyed the object we created using null i equaled the onstance to null to be distroyed

the main methode to run and calling all the methods and object we do

at the first calling get instance methode and compate if protocol 1 stay = protocol 2 in the same type

then make relese and get instance to check if we can do alot of 3 connection or not

the printing for list i call it in the add methode

i make a link list to add every type we entered
